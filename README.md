Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
=================================================

This repo is just for me to keep track of the exercises as I work through the
classic text.  I am trying to do a fairly quick pass for the moment so my
answers may not be the most beautiful/thought out the first time; I may go back
over old exercises from time to time if a better solution occurs to me.

I am using mit-scheme to do these because I may as well give it a proper shot.
