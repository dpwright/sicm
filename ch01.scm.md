Building Abstractions with Procedures
=====================================

Exercise 1.2
------------

*Translate the following expression into prefix form*

![\frac {5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + \frac {4} {5})))} {3(6 - 2)(2 - 7)}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%20%7B5%20&plus;%204%20&plus;%20%282%20-%20%283%20-%20%286%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%20%7B4%7D%20%7B5%7D%29%29%29%7D%20%7B3%286%20-%202%29%282%20-%207%29%7D)

```scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))))
   (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

Exercise 1.3
------------

*Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum
of the squares of the two larger numbers.*

```scheme
(define (ex1.3 x y z)
  (define (square x) (* x x))
  (define (max x y) (if (> x y) x y))
  (define (sum-of-squares x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))
  (if (> x y)
    (+ (sum-of-squares x (max y z)))
    (+ (sum-of-squares y (max x z)))))
```

Exercise 1.4
------------

*Describe the behaviour of the following procedure:*

    (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
      ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

This will add b to a if b is positive, otherwise it will subtract it.
In other words it adds the absolute value of b to a.

Exercise 1.5
------------

*Given the procedures:*

    (define (p) (p))
    (define (test x y)
      (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))

*What would be the result of running: (test 0 (p))?*

The answer is of course an infinite loop as it will attempt to evaluate the
value of (p) before calling the function (test) which discards it.  This is in
contrast to what would happen under normal-order (lazy) evaluation, in which
case the computation in the else branch of the if statement would never be run
and so (test 0 (p)) would simply return 0.

Exercise 1.6
------------

*What would happen if we attempted to use the following implementation to
compute square roots?*

    (define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
      (cond (predicate then-clause)
            (else else-clause)))
    (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
      (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
              guess
              (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                         x)))

The answer is an infinite loop, for the same reasons as outlined above.

Exercise 1.7
------------

*Design a square-root procedure that stops when the change is a very small
fraction of the guess, rather than when the square of the guess is a small
number away from the required result.*

```scheme
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess last-guess)
    (< (/ (abs (- guess last-guess))
          guess)
       0.001))

  (define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2))

  (define (improve guess x)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))

  (define (sqrt-iter guess last-guess x)
    (if (good-enough? guess last-guess)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 guess
                 x)))

  (sqrt-iter (improve 1.0 x) 1.0 x))
```

Exercise 1.8
------------

*Implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.*

```scheme
(define (cbrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess last-guess)
    (< (/ (abs (- guess last-guess))
          guess)
       0.001))

  (define (improve guess x)
    (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess))
       3))

  (define (cbrt-iter guess last-guess x)
    (if (good-enough? guess last-guess)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 guess
                 x)))

  (cbrt-iter (improve 1.0 x) 1.0 x))
```
